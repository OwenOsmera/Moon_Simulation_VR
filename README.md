## Developer

## Model Locations

I did not develop some of the assets and models that I will be using. The links for the websites are below.

NASA Resorces
- https://science.nasa.gov/3d-resources/

NASA has some really good space resources that I will be unsing to help with the emmsion of the simulation.

AssetStore.unity
- https://assetstore.unity.com/top-assets/top-free

The asset store has both models and scripting packeges that will help production of the environment.

Meta Horizon
- https://developers.meta.com/horizon/reference/unity/v78/

The Meta Horizon website has some great resorces for the player movement on the Oculus headset. They will come in handy when getting player movement working correctly.

#### Project Goal

Make a VR simulation of the moon that can be used to train people before they go into space.
